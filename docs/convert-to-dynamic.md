# Convert to Dynamic SQL
There are times while writing plain SQL, we find that we need dynamic SQL instead of plain one.
MinBatis provides an intention action to convert plain SQL to dynamic SQL.
This saves the time of moving caret and typing. The code is also well formatted after converted to dynamic SQL.
