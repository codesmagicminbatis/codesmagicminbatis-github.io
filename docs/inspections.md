# Error Highlighting
MinBatis resolves symbols according to how MyBatis framework uses them and highlights the symbols which MyBatis framework canâ€™t parse.
This feature can lead us to discover our code error earlier before we run the application.

# Inspections
MinBatis have many inspections which are implemented based on MyBatis source code.
They are very useful and save us a lot of time on debugging.
There are many inspections available now and we gonna add more of them in the futures.
