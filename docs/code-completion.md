# Code Completion
MinBatis provides various auto-completion and it's smart enough to suggest completion strings according to different contexts.

# Data Source
MinBatis provides IntelliJ data source integration which many data source related features are built upon (e.g., auto-completion, inspections, navigation, refactoring, etc.)
You can find more details about how to setup data source at [Managing data sources](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/managing-data-sources.html).

# SQL Dialect
Some features are available as soon as SQL dialect is configured, so you'd better configure the SQL dialect for your project.
You can find more details about how to configure SQL dialect at [SQL Dialects](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/sql-dialects.html).
